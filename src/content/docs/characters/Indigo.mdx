## Biography

</span>

Indigo was hit and killed by the [Isekai Truck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck-kun) one day and got flewed out into the furry afterlife. Being dead doesn't seem to bother him, though.

This is my VRChat avatar! I used [skip4d's Chibi Avatar Base](https://skip4d.gumroad.com/l/chibi) to make it!
It was really easy to work with and I highly recommend it if you want to make your own model in the same style.

I made the horns and halo myself using Blender, turned the upright rabbit ears to the side to make cow ears,
and modified a [glasses model by iPoly3D](https://poly.pizza/m/Dz9SyIEq7w) to fit. It's even "Good" rated on
PC and Quest! (which was a lot of work to get right!!!)
